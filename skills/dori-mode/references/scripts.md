# Scripts

`scripts/` is a bun + TypeScript package with one CLI, `dori`. Every external command runs as an argv array; nothing builds a shell string.

## Install and test

```sh
cd skills/dori-mode/scripts
bun install          # dev dependencies only (types, tsc)
bun link             # puts `dori` on your PATH
bun test             # behavior tests with fake herdr/git/gh; nothing real is touched
bunx tsc --noEmit    # typecheck
```

Needs: bun 1.3+, herdr, git, and the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for `merged`/`closed` signals (npm for `published`). The `command`, `file` and `url` signals need nothing extra. The full list of signal kinds is in `sessions.md`. The host guard reads `sysctl`, `memory_pressure` and `df` on macOS; on Linux it reads `/proc/loadavg`, `/proc/meminfo` (`MemAvailable` over `MemTotal`) and `df`. Memory counts as 100% free when neither source works, and swap reads as unknown on Linux.

## Configuration

`~/.dori/config.json` (or the path in `DORI_CONFIG`). Every field is optional; see `config.example.json`. `DORI_STATE_DIR` and `DORI_LEAD_PANE` override the file.

| Field | Default | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `stateDir` | `~/.dori/state` | registry, heavy slots |
| `laneWorkspace` | current workspace | `launch` |
| `workspaces` | all | `sync`, `dead-panes` |
| `ignorePanes`, `leadPane` | none | panes the sweeps skip; `leadPane` is also where lanes report |
| `defaultCwd` | home | where lanes start, and the repo whose worktrees they own |
| `agentCommand`, `defaultModel`, `launchKeywords` | `omo --model {model} {prompt}` | `launch` |
| `goalMarker` | `Pursuing goal` | `launch`: the agent's status text while a goal is active; empty turns the goal check off, and a value that is not a string uses the default |
| `sessionsDir` | `~/.omo/agent/sessions` | session-id lookup |
| `nudgeAfterMin`, `postAfterMin` | 15, 20 | `freshness` |
| `closeAfterMin` | 5 | `watch` |
| `heavySlots`, `heavyMaxLoad` | 1, 80 | `heavy` |
| `deadPanePatterns` | `has stopped`, `no suitable jobs` | `dead-panes` |
| `guard` | load 150/80, 20% memory, 50 GB disk, 20 panes | `guard` |
| `hooks.threadReply`, `hooks.threadDone` | none | `freshness`, `close` |
| `hooks.transcribe` | none | `transcribe` (argv with `{file}`, prints the text) |
| `supervision` | no ceilings by default (set wallMinutes, tokens or costUsd to enable); hung after 20 min | `freshness`, `launch`, `close` (see Supervision below) |
| `repoIdentities` | none | `verify-pr`, `launch` footer: expected Git name and email per `owner/repo` (keys match without case) |

Hooks are argv templates for your messenger CLI. `{thread}`, `{text}` and `{key}` are filled into each argument separately, so the text stays one argument whatever it contains.

## Library modules

The CLI is a thin layer over typed modules you can import in your own scripts:

| Module | What it gives you |
|---|---|
| `src/messenger/slack.ts` | `Slack`: post, edit, thread replies, file upload (upload URL + complete), presence; 429 backoff |
| `src/messenger/telegram.ts` | `Telegram`: send, edit, typing, `sendMessageDraft` streaming with a `Thinking…` start, forum topics (create, rename, close, reopen), HTML tables |
| `src/messenger/discord.ts` | `Discord`: send without pings, edit, typing, threads (start, rename, archive); gateway presence |
| `src/messenger/typing.ts` | `typingWhile`: show typing while a piece of work runs, stop when it ends |
| `src/messenger/voice.ts` | `transcribe`: voice note to text through your hook |
| `src/messenger/thread-ledger.ts` | `ThreadLedger`: every thread the Dori posts in, persisted; given to `Slack`, it records each `chat.postMessage` (also raw `call`s) |
| `src/messenger/slack-inbound.ts` | `pollSlackInbound`: threads view, the ledger's threads and unread counts, deduplicated, own messages filtered |
| `src/messenger/telegram-inbound.ts` | `pollTelegramInbound`: owner-gated `getUpdates` long-poll, persisted offset, DMs and the group gate |
| `src/messenger/discord-inbound.ts` | `DiscordInbound`: gateway socket with heartbeat and reconnect, per-channel cursors, REST backfill, media refs |
| `src/messenger/slack-presence.ts` | `slackPresence`: hold a user account active |
| `src/routing.ts` | `canLaunch`, `idleLaneFor`: the routing checks |

Every module takes its HTTP, clock and timers as arguments. That is how the tests run without the network.

## Commands

### `dori launch <key> --title T --brief FILE --done "..." [--thread REF] [--model M] [--cwd DIR] [--dry-run]`
Opens a lane: puts the repo's lessons (below) above the brief, appends the footer, opens a tab, starts the agent, and after 20 seconds checks it: `STARTUP_ERROR` on a known failure in the pane (at that check, or on an idle agent with no goal during the goal wait), `STARTUP_OK` only when herdr reports the agent idle or working and `goalMarker` (unless that is empty) shows in the pane's footer, its last three non-empty lines, so agent output above it does not count, `STARTUP_NO_GOAL` when the agent runs but shows no goal for another 60 seconds, and `STARTUP_UNCONFIRMED` (with the last lines) otherwise. Exit 3 on anything but `STARTUP_OK`.

`--dry-run` prints the brief as the lane would get it, lessons and footer included, and changes nothing.

### `dori adopt <key> --pane ID --title T --brief FILE --done "..." [--thread REF]`
Registers a lane that is already running.

### `dori sync [--write]`
Prints `key | thread | pane | session | status` for every open lane and every unregistered agent pane, followed by drift. Read-only unless `--write`, which stores session ids.

### `dori report <key> --kind milestone|blocker|question|halted|done --text TEXT`
Run by a lane. Appends one record to `<stateDir>/lanes/<key>/reports.jsonl` and prints the `[REPORT] <key> | <kind> | <text>` line the lane then sends to the lead pane. Each record is a single append, so the lane and the lead can write at the same time without losing one. The last record is the lane's progress state: `milestone` is running, `blocker` and `question` blocked (a question waits on the owner's answer), `halted` halted, `done` done. The screen grammar takes the same five kinds. Text stays data: newlines are folded into the printed line, never into the journal. A corrupt journal is an error with its line number, never an empty state. Lanes opened by `dori launch` are told to report this way and are marked `reportProtocol: "jsonl-v1"`; launch starts their journal with a `running` activity record, which is not a report and is never posted.

### `dori boot`
Run by the lead after a restart or a compaction, before it trusts what it remembers. It is read-only: it writes no registry record, relaunches nothing and stops no watch. It prints:
- `SLACK authenticated user=... team=...` from `auth.test` when `DORI_SLACK_TOKEN` is set (`SLACK skipped` otherwise). This proves the token, not that messages arrive. It runs last, after the local checks below, and gives up after 10 seconds (`SLACK auth.test timed out after 10000 ms`). A response without a user or team id is `SLACK auth failed`.
- `PANES` with the lead pane's state, then `VANISHED <key> pane=...` for each open lane whose pane is gone (a `verified-done` lane is not flagged), and `UNREGISTERED <panes>` for panes no lane owns. If `herdr pane list` fails, no lane is called vanished.
- `REPORT <key> kind=... at=... state=...` for each launched (`jsonl-v1`) lane's last report, next to its registry status, since the two can disagree after a crash. A journal that holds only records dori wrote itself (the launch, a screen-detected stall) is `NO-REPORT <key>`, never a report, and a launched lane with no `reports.jsonl` yet is `NO-REPORT <key> ... (no journal)`. An adopted lane's journal is not read, as in `freshness`. An unreadable journal is `JOURNAL-ERROR <key>: ...` for that lane only; the other lanes are still checked.
- `WORKLOG open=<n>` and an `OPEN <id> "<title>" source="<ref>" next="..."` line for each open worklog item (see `dori worklog` below).
- `CLEANUP <keys> match=<key>:<field>:<pane|key> ...` and `STOP in the owner session only: kill_bash(...)` for persistent watches tied only to finished lanes (closed, verified done, or a `done` report). A watch is tied to a lane only by the lane's pane id, or its key, as a whole argv token of the watch's `command` or `target`; a description is prose and a path segment is not the lane, so a lane keyed `docs` never claims `CI for the docs site` or `tail -F build/docs/out.log`. `match=` names the field that tied it. A watch that mentions an open lane anywhere (description and paths included) is kept. It reads the terminal metadata in `<sessionsDir>/*/extensions/terminal` and the current session's (`PI_SESSION_DIR`, `PI_SESSION_FILE`). Only the session that owns a watch can stop it. Live watches are listed first, then delivery-paused ones (`deliveryPaused=true`, still running, so they still get a stop call). A watch past its `expiresAt` has ended on its own and is listed as `EXPIRED <keys> ... ; nothing to stop`. The metadata path is shell-quoted. A metadata file that cannot be read or parsed is printed as `MONITORS unreadable <path>` and skipped; the other files are still read.

Exit 0 ends with `BOOT checked`. A lane file that cannot be read or parsed, or a lanes path that cannot be listed, is `REGISTRY unreadable <path>`; the other lanes are still checked. Any input that could not be read (Slack, the registry, panes, a journal, the worklog, metadata) is printed and gives `BOOT incomplete`, exit 1.

### `dori checkpoint <key> --step ID --result TEXT --evidence PATH [--remote-effect RECEIPT]...` / `dori checkpoints <key>`
Run by a lane after each completed step, and on resume before doing work. Each step is one line in `<stateDir>/lanes/<key>/checkpoints.jsonl` with its result, evidence and the receipts of remote effects it completed (a push, a merge, a deploy). Recording the same step again with the same data returns the original, unchanged; different data for a recorded step is refused, and so is a receipt another step already recorded. Writes fsync the journal (and its directory when they create it) under a lock file, `checkpoints.jsonl.lock`, that records the writer's pid, host and time. A live writer's lock is refused with its pid and age. A lock whose pid is dead on this host, or that is two minutes old, is taken over, so a writer killed mid-write never locks the lane.

A lane reads its checkpoints before resuming and never repeats a recorded remote effect. A crash between a remote action and its checkpoint is not covered by the journal: read the live remote state first, and use the service's idempotency key where it has one.

### `dori verify-pr <owner/repo> <num> [--loop N] [--cwd DIR]`
Run before a lane claims PR work done. It reads the PR through `gh api` (the PR, every commit with all of its files, the PR's files, then the PR again) and checks:
- every commit's author and committer email is the one in `repoIdentities` for that repo, ignoring case. The name may differ. `noreply@github.com` is accepted only as the committer of a merge commit, even if it is the configured email. A repo with no configured identity fails before anything is read; `loadConfig` drops an entry whose `name` or `email` is not a nonempty string, so such a repo counts as unconfigured;
- a PR with `fix:` or `fix(<scope>):` commits (with or without `!`) that touch source changes at least one test. A test file counts when GitHub lists it as added, modified, renamed, copied or changed (not removed) and it is named as a test (`*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `test_*.py`, `*_test.go`, `*_test.py`) or sits in a `test`, `tests` or `__tests__` directory. Nothing under a `fixtures`, `__fixtures__`, `__snapshots__`, `helpers`, `fakes` or `mocks` directory counts. In a test directory, a file that is not named as a test does not count when its name is `setup`, `conftest`, `test-utils`, `fixture(s)`, `helper(s)`, `fake(s)` or `mock(s)`, or when it sits in a `setup`, `conftest` or `test-utils` directory; a file named as a test (`test/setup.test.ts`, `test/helpers.test.ts`) counts. A body line `No test: <reason>` waives this. A fix commit without its own test is a warning, since its test may be in a later commit.

If the head, body or commit count changed between the two reads, or GitHub's answer is incomplete, the result is `FAIL`. Each `gh api` call is killed after 120 seconds, which is also a `FAIL`. Changed UI tests (`.tsx`/`.jsx`, a `ui`, `component(s)`, `feature(s)`, `e2e`, `browser` or `playwright` directory, or DOM calls in the patch) are listed with a shell loop that runs them `--loop` times (default 20) at the reported head. dori never runs the loop. `PASS` exits 0, `FAIL` exits 2.

### `dori claim-done [<key>] --evidence TEXT` / `dori object-done <key> --reason TEXT ...`
The two halves of the done flow. Both message the lane's pane and check that Enter registered.

### `dori close <key> [--note TEXT]`
Closes a lane now. Refuses (exit 2) unless every `Done =` signal reads back live. On success it marks the thread done through `hooks.threadDone`, closes the tab, and removes the lane's worktrees with a plain `git worktree remove`, which refuses a dirty worktree.

### `dori lesson add <key> --rule TEXT --evidence PATH [--cwd DIR]` / `lesson list [--cwd DIR]` / `lesson mark <id> --outcome ...`
A lesson is one rule learned in a lane, tied to the evidence that taught it and to the lane's repo (its `cwd`, resolved to a real path). `dori launch` puts up to 8 of the newest `pending` or `helped` lessons for the new lane's `cwd` above its brief, under "Lessons for this repo". `mark` records whether a lesson `helped`, had `no-effect`, was `harmful`, or is now `encoded` in a test, lint or doc; only `pending` and `helped` reach new briefs. Lessons live in `<stateDir>/lessons.jsonl`, one record per change: a mark appends, it never rewrites history. A rule is one line of at most 400 characters. A damaged line (not JSON, an unknown field, a malformed field, or a change to a lesson's fixed fields) is skipped and named: `lesson list` and `launch` print `LESSON_WARNING <path>:<line>: <reason>` on stderr and go on with the other lessons. The reason names the field for a malformed, unknown or changed field; a line that is not JSON, or not a JSON object, has no field to name and is reported as such. Each record starts on its own line, so a write cut off halfway damages only its own line.

`dori close <key> --lesson TEXT [--evidence PATH]` adds a lesson as part of the close (evidence defaults to the `Done =` line). It never blocks the close: a failure prints `LESSON_WARNING`.

### `dori worklog add <title> --source REF` / `next <id> <text>` / `note <id> <text>` / `close <id> --result TEXT` / `list [--open]`
The lead's record of owner requests, so an open request survives a restart, a compaction or a handoff. `add` records a request when it arrives, with its source (`slack:<channel>/<ts>` or any reference to the message) and prints the item with its 8-hex-digit id. `next` replaces the item's next step, `note` adds a dated note (a decision, who owns it), `close` records the result and ends the item; a closed or unknown item is refused. Each text is one line, without control characters (C0, DEL, C1) or the Unicode line and paragraph separators. `list` prints the items as JSON (`--open` only the open ones), oldest first.

The record is `<stateDir>/worklog.jsonl`, one append per change, so the lead and a lane can write at the same time without losing one; a write cut off halfway damages only its own line, which every reader skips quietly as a normal result of the design (a line that does not parse but begins like a record, `{"op":"`). Any other bad line is real damage: `list` names it as `WORKLOG_WARNING <path>:<line>: <reason>` and skips it. If two writers close the same item at once, the first close in the record wins and a later `close` is a no-op; a `next` or `note` after the close lost the same race: it is skipped and `list` still names it as a `WORKLOG_WARNING`. After every change `<stateDir>/worklog.md` is rendered from the whole record (temp file and rename) for the lead to read: one heading per item with Source, Opened, Next, Notes and, once closed, Closed and Result, open items first. A render that raced another writer's append renders again, so the file always ends up holding every item. Edit through the command, not the file: a `worklog.md` that the command did not write (no marker on its first line) is never replaced (the marker is checked before the append and again right before the rename, and a publish that finds it gone is skipped), and every change is refused until it is moved aside.

`dori boot` prints `WORKLOG open=<n>` and one `OPEN <id> "<title>" source="<ref>" next="<next step>"` line per open item, so the lead continues each from its Next line. A damaged line (not a torn write, a duplicate close, or a `next`/`note` after a close) is `WORKLOG damaged <path>:<line>: <reason>` and makes the boot incomplete. A `next` or `note` after a close prints as `WORKLOG warning <path>:<line>: <reason>` and does not fail the boot.

### `dori pause <key> [--note TEXT]` / `dori resume <key> [--note TEXT]`
`pause` is for when the owner said wait. It works on a `working` or `not-done` lane. It sends `/goal pause` to the lane's pane, then reads the screen back until the goal command's own line appears on a line of its own: `Goal paused`, or `cannot update goal: no goal exists`, since a lane with no goal has nothing to continue. Only then does it mark the lane `paused` (recorded in its history) and send Escape if a turn is running. The goal is paused first, so stopping the turn cannot hand off to a goal continuation. If the line does not appear, or the send fails, the lane is left as it was and the command prints `PAUSE_UNVERIFIED` and exits 3.

A paused lane is skipped by `freshness`: no nudge, no post. Only `dori resume` ends a pause, on the owner's word. Activity never does, because a paused lane can still be woken by a background result, a queued message or a turn after Escape. If its pane reads `working` on two ticks in a row, `freshness` prints `WORKING-WHILE-PAUSED` once per working stretch (again after it goes idle and is woken, or after a new pause), so the lead can ask the owner, and the lane stays paused.

`resume` sends `/goal resume` and reads back `Goal active` the same way, then restores the status the lane had before the pause (`pausedFrom`) and restarts its quiet time, so a long pause does not turn into an instant nudge. Unconfirmed: `RESUME_UNVERIFIED`, exit 3.

Both print `PAUSED` / `RESUMED` and exit 0 on success. A lane in any other state is refused (`NOT_PAUSED` / `NOT_RESUMED`, exit 2), and a second `pause` is a no-op. `claim-done` and `object-done` on a paused lane move it out of `paused` in the registry while its goal stays paused.

### `dori watch`
Runs forever. Every 30 seconds it prints each new claim once (`LANE_DONE_CLAIMED`). Claims older than `closeAfterMin` are settled: unpushed or uncommitted work and failing signals turn into objections (`LANE_NOT_DONE`); otherwise the lane is closed (`LANE_CLOSED`). The deadline lives in the registry, so a restart picks up where it left off.

### `dori freshness [--loop MIN]`
For working lanes that have gone quiet: a nudge in the pane after `nudgeAfterMin`, then the lane's last `[REPORT]` line posted to its thread after `postAfterMin`, with home paths and pane ids scrubbed. Each happens once per silence. The line is posted only once it is still the last `[REPORT]` line on the next tick (`PENDING-REPORT` the first time) and differs from the line posted last time (`STALE-REPORT` otherwise). A `[REPORT]` line counts when it starts the row or is a whole quoted element of an argv array, the shape lanes send it in (`["herdr", "pane", "run", "<lead pane>", "[REPORT] key | kind | text"]`). Prose that quotes the grammar mid-sentence, and a report whose text is one unfilled placeholder, are not reports. A held-back outcome is printed once per change, not on every tick. A nudge reports its delivery as `delivered` (the agent status moved to working) or `unconfirmed`.

A lane with a `reports.jsonl` journal is read from the journal first. Its last report skips the two-tick `PENDING-REPORT` wait, since it cannot scroll off, and is posted once the thread has had no update for `postAfterMin`, so a lane that reports often still has its latest report posted, at most once per `postAfterMin`. Its time counts as the lane last being heard from, so a fresh report suppresses the nudge. A `blocker`, `question`, `halted` or `done` lane is not nudged, but its report is still posted. A `stalled` lane is neither nudged nor posted: it stopped on a failed compaction or at an idle prompt, so a typed nudge cannot restart it and a person has to look. `STALLED` is printed once per stall for the monitor (see the filter in `setup.md`), and `Working` on the screen returns the lane to running, after which nudges and posts resume. A `jsonl-v1` lane never falls back to scraping the screen. `launch` starts its journal with a `running` activity record, which is not a report, so a lane with no report of its own is `NO-REPORT` and is still watched for a stall; a `jsonl-v1` lane with no journal at all is `NO-REPORT` and is not watched. The screen is still read for activity: a compaction failure with no `Working` line below it, or an idle prompt with no `Working` line and no report for `nudgeAfterMin`, marks the lane `stalled` and prints `STALLED` once; `Working` on the screen moves it back to running. A journal that does not parse skips its lane and prints `JOURNAL-ERROR` with the file and line, once per error; the other lanes are still swept. Adopted lanes ignore the journal and keep the screen path. On the screen, a report is a line that starts with `[REPORT]` (after indentation) or the last quoted element of an argv row such as `["herdr", "pane", "run", "lead:p1", "[REPORT] ..."]`, optionally inside one spawn call. Prose, an instruction or a prompt that quotes the grammar mid-sentence is dropped.

#### Supervision
For launched (`jsonl-v1`) lanes whose `reports.jsonl` journal exists, each `freshness` tick also checks the items below. An adopted lane is not supervised: it has no ceilings and no hung-call check, even if a journal exists for its key.
- **Ceilings.** `wallMinutes` since the lane opened, and `tokens` and `costUsd` from `supervision.usageArgv`. Reaching one appends a `blocker` report and prints `BLOCKED`. The lane is never killed, closed or sent anything; it waits for the lead, and raising a ceiling alone does not resume it. Limits come from `supervision.defaults`, then `supervision.lanes.<key>`, then `launch --wall-minutes N|none --token-limit N|none --cost-limit N|none`, and are saved on the lane. `null` (`none`) disables one. A malformed `supervision` entry (a ceiling that is not a nonnegative number or `null`, a ceiling or setting name that does not exist, such as `toknes`, a `lanes` entry that is not an object, an argv or path list that is not strings) stops every command with `invalid supervision <name>`, so a typo never turns a ceiling off.
- **Hung calls.** A `Working` or `Running` timer on the screen that keeps growing from the same start for `hungAfterMinutes`, with no new report, checkpoint or file change for `staleAfterMinutes`, marks the lane stalled (`STALLED`). File changes are git's changed-file list in the lane's `cwd` (`gitActivity`), leaving out `node_modules` and paths outside `cwd`, plus `activityPaths` and `launch --activity-path FILE`; directories are not walked.
- **Usage.** `supervision.usageArgv` is an argv template (`{key}`, `{session}`, `{cwd}`) that prints `{"tokens": N, "costUsd": N}` cumulative totals. Missing or malformed values are unknown, never zero, and a ceiling that cannot be checked prints `WARNING` once. With `usageArgv` set, each reading is appended to the lane's `cost.jsonl`; without it, sweeps record nothing.

Each alert prints once per change. `close` takes one more usage reading, prints `COST <key> tokens=... costUsd=...`, and, when either is known, runs `supervision.recordCostArgv` (`{key}`, `{session}`, `{tokens}`, `{costUsd}`, `{at}`, and `{closeKey}`, `<key>@<openedAt>`, the same on every attempt; unknown values are the literal `null`). Once the hook succeeds the reading is marked final in `cost.jsonl`, and a later close of the same lane returns it without running the hook again. If that hook fails, close prints `COST <key> not recorded: <reason>` and still closes the lane. A supervision step that fails (an unreadable `supervision.json` or checkpoint journal) prints `SUPERVISION-ERROR <key> <reason>` once per reason; that lane's reports are still read and posted, and the other lanes are still checked. Both hooks run without a shell and time out after 10 seconds. Run one `freshness` sweeper for all lanes: each tick covers every open lane, so a second sweeper would repeat nudges, thread posts and supervision alerts.

### `dori dead-panes [--loop MIN]`
Prints `DEAD_PANE <id>` once per hour for a pane with no running agent status whose last lines match `deadPanePatterns` on two ticks in a row with the same text. A pane herdr reports as idle, working, blocked or done is never dead. A pane that is neither is unrecognised; three unrecognised ticks in a row print `UNRECOGNISED_PANE <id> ...` once (list non-agent panes in `ignorePanes`).

### `dori guard [--loop MIN]`
Prints `HOST_GUARD ALERT <reasons>` when load, free memory, free disk or the pane count crosses its threshold, and `HOST_GUARD CLEAR` when it recovers. It also prints `COMPUTE_READY` / `COMPUTE_BUSY` as load crosses `loadOk`. Only changes are printed.

### `dori can-launch`
Prints `CAN_LAUNCH` and exits 0 when the host has room for another lane. Otherwise it prints `HOLD <reasons>` and exits 4. The reasons come from the guard's memory, disk and pane-count thresholds. CPU load alone never holds a launch, because it moves too fast to plan around.

### `dori send <slack|telegram|discord> --to TARGET --text TEXT [--thread ID] [--edit ID]`
Posts a message, or edits one with `--edit`. Tokens come from `DORI_SLACK_TOKEN` (plus `DORI_SLACK_COOKIE` for a user token), `DORI_TELEGRAM_TOKEN` or `DORI_DISCORD_TOKEN`. Text containing `$(` is refused, since it can only come from a shell string. Rate limits are retried with the server's wait time; other errors fail at once.

### `dori presence <slack|discord>`
Keeps the account shown as online until stopped.
- **Discord:** the bot connects to the gateway and identifies as online.
- **Slack, user token:** it opens one web-client-type socket and tickles it every minute. Slack shows a user active only while such a socket is open, and auto-aways an idle one after about 30 minutes.
- Run one instance per account. Two writers flip each other's presence.

### `dori inbound slack [--loop MIN]`
Prints `INBOUND <source> <channel> <thread> <ts> <user> <text>`. It reads from three places, each message once:
- `threads-view`: unread replies in threads the account follows (Slack's own Threads view);
- `own-thread`: new replies in any thread the Dori posted in, tagged or not;
- `unread`: DMs, group DMs and channels with unread mentions.

The Dori's own messages and bot messages are skipped. Every message the Dori posts records its thread in `<stateDir>/slack-threads.json`, whichever helper sends it, so a guest's untagged reply under a root posted with a raw API call is still found.

### `dori inbound telegram [--loop MIN]`
Prints `INBOUND <source> <chat> <thread> <update-id> <from> <text>[ file=<kind>:<file_id>]`, keeping Slack's field order — `source` is `dm`, `topic`, `edit:dm` or `edit:topic`. A media message appends ` file=<kind>:<file_id>` (voice, audio, video, video_note, animation, document, photo); the line carries the `file_id`, which a caller can pass to Telegram's `getFile`. Long-polls `getUpdates`:
- only the configured owner's messages pass (`DORI_TELEGRAM_OWNER_ID`); bot messages never do;
- DMs from the owner always pass; in a group (`DORI_TELEGRAM_GROUP_ID`) only the configured topic (`DORI_TELEGRAM_TOPIC_ID`) does — with a group but no topic, every owner message in the group passes — with no group configured, DMs only;
- delivery is at-least-once: the offset in `<stateDir>/telegram-offset` advances past a message only after its `INBOUND` line is out (dropped updates advance immediately), so a crash replays at worst the unprinted lines — duplicates carry the same update id;
- the full text is printed, JSON-escaped on one line: `getUpdates` cannot fetch a message again;
- edits arrive too: `edited_message` updates are polled and printed as their own `edit` kind, carrying the edited text;
- env ids are validated at start — `DORI_TELEGRAM_OWNER_ID`, `DORI_TELEGRAM_GROUP_ID` and `DORI_TELEGRAM_TOPIC_ID` must match `/^-?\d+$/` after trimming; empty, whitespace-only, `1e3` and `0x10` are refused with an error naming the variable;
- reuses the bot token the skill already stores (`DORI_TELEGRAM_TOKEN`).

### `dori inbound discord`
Prints `INBOUND discord <source> <channel> <guild> <message-id> <author> <text>`, keeping the same field order as Slack: `source` is `guild` or `dm`, `guild` is the guild id or `-` for a DM, and `text` is JSON-escaped on one line. A message with images or videos appends `media=<path>,...`, and a reply appends `reply_to=<id>` with `reply_author=` and `reply_text=` when Discord sent the referenced message. The bot's own messages are skipped; messages from other bots are delivered like anyone else's. It holds a gateway socket (`wss://gateway.discord.gg/?v=10&encoding=json`) open and prints `INBOUND_READY discord` once the socket and backfill have started:
- the token comes from `DORI_DISCORD_TOKEN`, the same variable `dori send discord` reads; the bot id is fetched from `/users/@me` so its own messages can be filtered;
- `MESSAGE_CONTENT` is a **privileged intent**: without it Discord blanks `content`, `attachments` and `embeds` on guild messages (DMs with the bot, and messages that mention it, keep their `content`). A text-only or attachment-only guild message then fails `toInbound` and is dropped, and a mention loses its images. Enable it in the Developer Portal under Bot -> Privileged Gateway Intents; the receiver asks for `GUILD_MESSAGES`, `DIRECT_MESSAGES` and `MESSAGE_CONTENT`, and Discord closes the connection with `4014` if a requested privileged intent was not granted;
- a restart asks Discord for what it missed: `<stateDir>/discord-inbound-cursors.json` holds one cursor per channel (written through a temp file), and each stored channel's REST history is paged from its cursor forward, up to 2,000 messages (20 pages of 100), after which the run says it stopped at the page limit;
- the cursor for a channel means "everything up to this id is handled", so the bot's own messages and anything filtered still move it forward and are not fetched again;
- a backfilled message's guild is looked up once per channel (`GET /channels/<id>`), since REST message payloads carry no `guild_id` and a backfilled message would otherwise print as a DM; the text is printed whole (Discord caps it at 2,000 characters and JSON escaping keeps it on one line);
- images and videos are downloaded to `<stateDir>/discord-media/` (10 MB cap; when `ffmpeg` is installed, a video also gets a frame at 0.5 s) and their paths ride on the line;
- a channel the bot cannot read (403/404) is skipped rather than fatal, and a failed history call stops that channel's backfill and prints the reason on `stderr`;
- a message is reported once per id within a run (the last 500 ids are kept); across a restart the per-channel cursor is the dedupe base, so anything the cursor has not passed can be printed again;
- the socket reconnects itself when Discord asks for it (`op 7`), the session is invalidated (`op 9`), or a heartbeat ack is missed;
- delivery is at-least-once for every message: a line is printed first and only then does its channel cursor move (in memory, with the file write queued behind it). For a message with media that means the line waits for the downloads and the cursor follows the printed line, so a crash before the line replays the message from history on restart — the duplicate carries the same message id. Nothing is lost this way; a consumer that needs exactly-once dedupes on the id;

### `dori transcribe <audio-file>`
Runs `hooks.transcribe` and prints the transcript. A failed or empty transcription is an error, never an empty message.

### `dori heavy <label> -- <command ...>`
Waits until load is under `heavyMaxLoad` and one of `heavySlots` is free, then runs the command and frees the slot when it exits. A slot held by a process that no longer exists (or a zombie) is taken over. Use it for full builds and test suites. Installs, focused tests and git do not need it.
